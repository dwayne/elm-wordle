![A screenshot of the Wordle game](/screenshot.png)

An Elm clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). Wordle is a daily word guessing game created by [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/). It was subsequently [acquired by the New York Times Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle#Acquisition_by_the_New_York_Times_Company) for an "undisclosed price in low-seven figures."

**Disclaimer:** *This clone was solely created for educational purposes.*
